## üß¨ Project 1: Cancer Detection

**Objective:**  
Identify metastatic cancer in histopathologic images using deep learning. Classify small image patches extracted from pathology scans as **cancerous** or **non-cancerous**.

**Models Developed:**
- **Custom CNN**
- **Pre-trained ResNet50**

**Key Outcomes:**
- Custom CNN achieved **~80% training accuracy** and **~75% validation accuracy**.
- ROC-AUC for Custom CNN: **0.5065**  
- ROC-AUC for ResNet50: **0.4640**

**Challenges:**  
- Models struggled to differentiate cancerous and non-cancerous tissue effectively.  
- Potential issues: class imbalance, data complexity, need for advanced architectures, and hyperparameter tuning.

**Conclusion:**  
The project highlights the complexity of histopathologic image classification. While CNN-based approaches show potential, further enhancements are required for reliable deployment.

## üé® Project 2: CGAN for Monet-style Painting Generation

**Objective:**  
Generate Monet-style paintings from real photos using a **CycleGAN** architecture.

**Dataset:**  
- Photos and Monet paintings, **256x256 RGB images**
- Unpaired examples

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Fine-tune hyperparameters (learning rates, epochs)
- Stabilize training using gradient penalty, instance normalization, or WGAN
- Monitor overfitting by balancing generator and discriminator

**Conclusion:**  
The Cycle GAN model learns to translate between photo and painting domains but shows training instability. Further tuning is needed for higher-quality generation.

## üìä Project 3: Advanced Customer Segmentation & Predictive Analysis

**Objective:**  
Segment customers and predict **high-value customers** using the **Online Retail Dataset** (UK-based, Dec 2010‚ÄìDec 2011).

**Analysis Highlights:**
- Most customers purchase regularly (Recency ~111 days)
- Cluster 1 contains loyal customers with high Frequency & Monetary value
- Some customers are one-time visitors (guests)

**Model Performance:**
- **R¬≤ Score:** 1.0  
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** 3.71e-10  
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** 1.70e-19  

**Conclusion:**  
Predictive models are highly accurate in identifying potential high-value customers, aiding targeted marketing and retention strategies.
